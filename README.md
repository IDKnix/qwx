# Qwriter 0-A1 Is Out!

Now, you are probably like, nah this kid again? And, yes, I know. This is my old Inkpens project but rewritten in go.
I will add more stuff after some time. This is built to be fast, efficient and lighweight.

## Wanna Install?

#### Build from source

If you want to do build from source then simply take the main.go file, use ```go build``` to build it to an executable. If you want you can move it to path or something like that. Yes, you do need to have golang installed for this to work.

#### Normal human way

To install it the normal way, just clone the repo and run the userinstall script. 

```git clone https://github.com/IDKnix/qwx.git```

```cd qwx```

```./userinstall```

#### Windows compatibilty?

Yes and no. You can't compile it in Windows but the files will run, without the userinstall script because of the directory differences. So yes, it would run if you were to run it only with:

```
go run main.go
```

Thats it for me I'm pretty sure.
